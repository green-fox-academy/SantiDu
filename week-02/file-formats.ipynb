    "    and transport data.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- How the data is stored in XML files?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    It is stored between an opening and a closing tag. More tags can follow each\n",
    "    other so it can represent any complex structure. It is similar to HTML however\n",
    "    in XML there are no predefined tags. It is flexible and customizable.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- Can we nest data in XML files?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Just like in HTML any tag can contain 0 or more other tags, so you can nest\n",
    "    data.\n",
    "    <employee>\n",
    "      <name>...</name>\n",
    "      <department>...</department>\n",
    "    </employee>\n",

    "- How can we add special information to the data in XML?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    We can define attributes on the tags just like in HTML.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is the CSV format used for?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    CSV can describe data as it would be a table. It has columns and rows.\n",
    "    Columns are separated by a colon.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is the difference between CSV and TSV?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    In TSV the columns are separated with tabs.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- Are there different types of CSV?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Sometimes we separate the columns with a semi-colon, to prevent the confusion\n",
    "    when a value contains a colon.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is JSON?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    JavaScript Object Notation, a widely used file format to transfer and store\n",
    "    data. It comes from the JS object format.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What are the valid data types in JSON?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Array, boolean, number, string, null, object\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is the benefit/drawback of JSON over XML?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    JSON is much shorter so it takes less space.\n",
    "    XML can add metadata to the values.\n",
