    "- What is inheritance?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Different kinds of objects often have a certain amount in common with each\n",
    "    other. Mountain bikes, road bikes, and tandem bikes, for example, all share\n",
    "    the characteristics of bicycles (current speed, current pedal cadence,\n",
    "    current gear). Yet each also defines additional features that make them\n",
    "    different: tandem bicycles have two seats and two sets of handlebars; road\n",
    "    bikes have drop handlebars; some mountain bikes have an additional chain\n",
    "    ring, giving them a lower gear ratio.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is multiple inheritance?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    It is a concept which is rarely supported in object oriented languages. In\n",
    "    python it is. Each class can extend more than one class so you can inherit\n",
    "    from multiple classes. This concept makes easier to create complex classes\n",
    "    but also can drive into problematic situations.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is the diamond problem?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    The \"diamond problem\" is the generally used term for an ambiguity that\n",
    "    arises when two classes B and C inherit from a superclass A, and another\n",
    "    class D inherits from both B and C. If there is a method \"m\" in A that B or\n",
    "    C (or even both of them) has overridden, and furthermore, if does not\n",
    "    override this method, then the question is which version of the method does\n",
    "    D inherit?\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is a base class?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features. It is\n",
    "    also called a base class or a parent class.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is a derived class?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a\n",
    "    derived class, extended class, or child class.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- How can I use classes from other files?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    You can import functions or classes by the import keyword. There are two ways\n",
    "    to import something \n",
    "      import functions - then you can call func_one by functions.func_one()\n",
    "      from functions import func_one then - you can call func_one by func_one()\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What's the difference between the _is-a_ and _has-a_ relationship?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    A house has a room while water is a drink.\n",
    "    The VW Beatle is a car, but the Garage is not a car, but has a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is an easy way to determine whether you should use inheritance or not at\n",
    "    the beginning.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- Why is inheritance useful?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).\n",
    "    For Code Reusability.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is the usage of the `super()` function?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    super() function returns the parent class so it can be used to refer\n",
    "    immediate parent class instance variable or to invoke immediate parent class\n",
    "    method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    https://realpython.com/python-super/\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- When do we need to call `super().__init__()` method?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    When we define a subclass we will need to call the parent's constructor\n",
    "    within our __init__ method. You can do the with super().__init__();\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- How can you check if a class extends another class?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    issubclass(object, [class, type, or tuple of classes and types])\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is polymorphism?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Within an inheritance hierarchy, a subclass can override a method of its\n",
    "    superclass. That enables the developer of the subclass to customize or\n",
    "    completely replace the behavior of that method.\n",
    "    Both methods, implemented by the super- and subclass, share the same name\n",
    "    and parameters but provide different functionality.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is the difference between overriding and overloading?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Overriding means that you are implementing an inherited method while\n",
    "    overloading means that you are creating a method with the same name but\n",
    "    different parameters.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- How to safely cast a variable from one type to another?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Use the 'isinstance' operator and (Type).\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is the difference between implicit and explicit casting?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Implicit casting or widening or automatic type conversion can happen if both\n",
    "    type are compatible and target type is larger than source type.\n",
    "    For example int -> float\n",
    "\n",
    "    Explicit casting or narrowing is required when you are assigning a larger\n",
    "    type to a smaller type.\n",
    "    For example float -> int\n",
