    "- What is OOP?\n",
    "  <!-- \n",
    "    OOP is a paradigm that is concerned mainly with the way that code is organized.\n",
    "    It gives us classes, and other tools to group similar things together.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- Do we have other paradigms?\n",
    "  <!-- \n",
    "    Yes, we have different paradigms. Moreover languages can follow more paradigms.\n",
    "    eg.: functional, procedural etc..\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- Is OOP the best?\n",
    "  <!-- \n",
    "    No, there is no best paradigm. It depends on the given problem, environment\n",
    "    and sometimes taste.\n",
    "    comparisson: Stateful - Stateless\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is a class?\n",
    "  <!-- \n",
    "    It is a blueprint. It tells what makes something a \"thing\".\n",
    "    The Bird is a class, \n",
    "      - it tells us that each bird has wings, feet but they don't have any teeth\n",
    "        or battery\n",
    "      - they can fly, eat but they can't write or drive a car.\n",
    "    You can use that blueprint to create different instances of that class.\n",
    "    Eg.: A white eagle or a black falcon, etc...\n",
    "    They will behave the same but their properties will differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Think them as real blueprints, you can build white, red any colored house\n",
    "    from the same blueprint, you can change even the windows, but the sizes will\n",
    "    be the same and you can enter the building the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since it is a concept, a thing it has always singular name!!!\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What are nested classes in python?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    In python you can define classes within another classes. It doesn't mean that\n",
    "    the have any relationship. For example you cannot access the outer class's\n",
    "    methods or properties from the inner class.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is the constructor  (`__init__(self)` method)?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    This will be called when you create a new instance of the class.\n",
    "    All the classes have a default empty constructor w/o any parameters. If you\n",
    "    want to do something during the instantiation you have to define your own\n",
    "    constructor.\n",
    "    You can define more constructors so your class can be instantiated in\n",
    "    different ways.\n",
    "    Usually we assign value to the instance variables, we initialize the instance\n",
    "    in the constructor. We shouldn't have any side effect in the constructor.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What does the self keyword mean?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    It references to the instance, you can use it to access your props and\n",
    "    methods\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is the difference between classes and instances?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    You are the instance, Person is the class. Person is a concept, You are one\n",
    "    concrete example of that concept.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What are fields, props?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    These are the properties what each instance must own but they have different\n",
    "    values in each instance.\n",
    "    Eg.: Each Person has\n",
    "      - hair color\n",
    "      - length\n",
    "      - weight\n",
    "      - eye color\n",
    "\n",
    "    These properties hold the current state of the instance.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What are the methods?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    These are those action what can be made on your instance or can be performed\n",
    "    by the instance. \n",
    "    For example a Person can\n",
    "      - eat(Food)\n",
    "      - drive(Car)\n",
    "      - hit(Person)\n",
    "      - sleep()\n",
    "\n",
    "    These actions will change the instance's current state or will interact with\n",
    "    other objects/instances.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is encapsulation?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    In order to keep the internal consistency you have to hide your internal\n",
    "    state.\n",
    "      - A Car, if it is driven, the fuel_level is decreasing and the run_kms is\n",
    "        increasing. If the run_kms would be public you would be able to change\n",
    "        it without lowering the fuel_level.\n",
    "      - If you have a bank account you need a transaction to change the balance.\n",
    "        If the balance would be public it could be editable without any history.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Sometimes you want to hide a complex system from the user, because he doesn't\n",
    "    want to deal with implementation details.\n",
    "     - You don't now how an array stores its values. You just call the function\n",
    "       on it.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What are the access modifiers?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    However there are no access modifiers in Python, it is a very important\n",
    "    concept what must understood by each developer.\n",
    "    Access modifiers (or access specifiers) are keywords in object-oriented\n",
    "    languages that set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members.\n",
    "    Access modifiers are a specific part of programming language syntax used to\n",
    "    facilitate the encapsulation of components.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The access modifier in the parent class can't be looser than in the subclass\n",
    "    because it would harm the polymorphism.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- How can we achieve encapsulation in python?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    With the property decorator. you can add the @property annotation to a\n",
    "    method or by using the property method to assign a value to a field.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- How does the SRP come up in OOP?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    SRP: It means one thing must do only one thing. This is not the right\n",
    "    definition but it is a good start.\n",
    "    In OOP each class must deal with only one topic/thing. It should not write\n",
    "    files and calculate complex logic.\n",
    "    Indicator: too many properties, the properties are used in different methods.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is a class variable?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    It is defined on the class, not on the instances. You remeber only one class\n",
    "    exists, so in his case we will have only one variable.\n",
    "    Each instances will have the same variable so if one changes it all the other\n",
    "    instances will point to the new value.\n",
    "    Eg. A counter which counts how many instances have been created from the class.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- How can you defined class/static variables?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Each property defined within the class but outside a method will be a static\n",
    "    variable.\n",
    "  -->\n",
