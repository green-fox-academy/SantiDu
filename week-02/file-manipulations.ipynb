    "- What is the difference between compile time errors and runtime errors?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Compile time rises when the computer builds your application.\n",
    "    Runtime error rises when the code is executed.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- Is syntax error a runtime error? Why?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Nope, it means the computer doesn't understand your code.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- Is semantic error a runtime error? Why?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Yes it means something went wrong in your program logic but syntactically it\n",
    "    is correct. Eg, You want to add 2 numbers but unfortunately you have used\n",
    "    subtraction operator.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exception handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the Exceptions?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Events that the computer cannot handle and fails to execute the code unless\n",
    "    it is explicitly handled by the developer\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What kind of errors do we have in Python?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    There are a lot of predefined errors out there. Like NameError, ValueError,\n",
    "    SyntaxError, TypeError, etc..\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- Can I throw exceptions/errors?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Yes, you can rise errors with the raise keyword.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- Can I handle these exceptions?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Not all of them. Eg out of memory or stack trace error cannot be handled.\n",
    "    The others can be caught with\n",
    "      try:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "      except:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "      finally:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is the try block used for?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Any error, which was thrown in this block or in any function called from\n",
    "    this block, can be handled in the preceding catch block\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is the catch block used for?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    You can handle the caught error. Eg, print something to the console. Create\n",
    "    logs, notify the user, etc...\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- Can I handle different kind of errors?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Yes, just specify the error in type in the catch argument. Pay attention to\n",
    "    the precedence, generic errors go to bottom, specific ones go to the top.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is the point of the finally block?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    The finally block executed anyway, if an exception has been caught if not,\n",
    "    even if you don't have any catch block at all. You can use it to free\n",
    "    resources, close files or even send a log to a server.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- Is it executed even if I return from the try block?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Yes, it is. It will be executed right after the return but before the control\n",
    "    have been given back to the callee.\n",

    "### File IO\n",
    "\n",
    "- `help()`\n",
    "- `os` library\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the File System?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    A filesystem is the methods and data structures that an operating system uses\n",
    "    to keep track of files on a disk; that is, the way the files are organized\n",
    "    on the disk\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is a file path?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    The route where the given file can be found. You can look at the file system\n",
    "    as a tree upside down. Each directory is a new branch and the leaves are the\n",
    "    files.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is the difference between relative and absolute path?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Absolute goes from the route of the tree, relative goes from your current\n",
    "    position.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is character encoding?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Of course our files are stored on the disk as 0's and 1's. The computer must\n",
    "    transform our letters into their more and more abstract representations.\n",
    "    Which will produce something understandable to the computer. This\n",
    "    transformation is the encoding.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is UTF-8?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    We have different character encodings, they are evolving of course. UTF-8 is\n",
    "    currently the most popular on the World Wide Web. ASCII is also quite common.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What are file permissions?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    Each file has an owner and of course it cannot be read or modified by anybody\n",
    "    r - read, w - write, x - execute. These permissions can be defined for the\n",
    "    owner, groups and anybody.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What is the `os` module?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    It is a built-in python module to access the operating system in the runner\n",
    "    environment. You can reach the filesystem, user management and other services\n",
    "    through the os module.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- How to read file content?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    First you need to open the file in read mode.\n",
    "    Then you can read the content with the read method.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- Can I read the file line by line?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    There is a readline() method which returns the next line in the file,\n",
    "    meanwhile you can read all the lines into a list as well with the readlines()\n",
    "    method.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- How to write a file?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    First you need to open the file in write mode.\n",
    "    Then you can write the content with the write method.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- How can I append something to a file?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    First you need to open the file in append mode.\n",
    "    Then you can append the content with the write method.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What happens if a file not found?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    An error will be thrown, must be handled in a try except block.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- Why is it necessary to close a file?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    The file will take place in the memory until it is closed.\n",
    "  -->\n",
    "- What does the `help()` do?\n",
    "  <!--\n",
    "    It calls the built-in Python help system. You can pass types, methods as\n",
    "    parameters to it and the manual will be printed.\n",
